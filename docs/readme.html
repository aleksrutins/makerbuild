<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To launch MakerBuild, <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="openIde()">Click this button</button>.
Please disable your popup blocker, because the MakerBuild IDE is a popup.
To make a new project, hit the &#39;New Project&#39; button.
It will create index.html, app.js, and project.json files in the project.
To save, hit Ctrl+S. To create a new file, hit Ctrl+N.
To preview your page in a dialog, go to &quot;view&quot; &gt; &quot;Preview&quot;. This will launch a modal.</p>

<h2>Coding Quirks</h2>

<p>Since I had to write the script-loading engine myself, there are a few quirks. I had to write it myself because the project is stored in a JSON object, not a directory.</p>

<h3>The First Quirk</h3>

<p>First up is with the script tag. As with any method of importing scripts (in the IDE), you have to have a &quot;./&quot; in front of all local URLs.</p>

<h3>The Second Quirk</h3>

<p>Second up is with export statements. You can only &quot;export default&quot;.</p>

<h3>The Third Quirk</h3>

<p>Third up is with import statements. This relates to the the second querk. Since you can only use default exports, the <code>import {var1, var2} from &#39;./module.js&#39;</code> syntax imports properties of an object you &#39;export default&#39;.</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>The app is tried, true, and tested in Firefox Developer Edition, Firefox Nightly for Android, and Chrome for Android. In desktop Chrome, everything except keyboard shortcuts works.</p>
